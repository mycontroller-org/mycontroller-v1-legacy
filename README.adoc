== About

*MyController.org* is an IoT automation controller for home, office or any place.
Primarly this project was started to support http://www.mysensors.org/[MySensors]. Later it was expanded to support other networks also. MyController.org was designed to run with limited resources. For instance, it can run on the first generation Raspberry Pi.

== Localization
MyController.org supports multiple languages. If you are interested in providing a translation for your native language, send a request via https://www.transifex.com/mycontrollerorg/multi-locale/[Transifex MyController.org locale project]

== System Requirements

MyController.org is a very lightweight server. Its resource requirements are modest:

  * Disk        : ~100 MB (may require more space, when we store metrics data for long time)
  * Memory(RAM) : 256 MB
  * Java        : 1.8 or later

===== Supported Platforms (tested)
MyController.org is a Java-based application server. It can run on any platform where Java support is available.

- Linux
- Windows
- Orange PI
- Raspberry PI (Oracle Java recommended)

== MyController and MySensors Setup

== Installation

====== Download(executable bundle),

* Visit MyController.org http://www.mycontroller.org/#/downloads[downloads page]

====== Configuration

Extract the downloaded bundle in the directory where you want it to run. The configuration files are located in `mycontroller/conf`

File: `mycontroller.properties`

*Temporary files*
----
mcc.tmp.location=tmp/ # <1>
----
<1> You can change the default location and file name. This directory is used as a temporary location for operations such as backup, restore, etc.

*Database Configuration*
----
mcc.db.h2db.location=../conf/mycontroller # <1>
----
<1> You can change the default location and file name. The database file will be stored with the extension `.h2.db`. Do not add file extension to this property.

*Web server configuration*
----
mcc.web.bind.address=0.0.0.0 # <1>
mcc.web.enable.https=true  # <2>
mcc.web.http.port=8443  # <3>
mcc.web.file.location=../www/  # <4>
mcc.web.ssl.keystore.file=../conf/keystore.jks  # <5>
mcc.web.ssl.keystore.password=mycontroller  # <5>
mcc.web.ssl.keystore.type=JKS  # <5>
----

<1> Bind interface address. 0.0.0.0 means it will bind to all available interfaces. 
<2> Enable/disable https. Only one protocol is supported at a time. true - `https`, false - `http`.
<3> Port number of `http/https` to access MyController.org server.
<4> Web files location, no need to touch this one.
<5> If `https` is enabled these fields are mandatory.

Default URL: `https://<ip>:8443` (ex: `https://localhost:8443`)

NOTE: Default username/password: `admin/admin`

*Important*: Change default `mcc.web.ssl.keystore.file` and `mcc.web.ssl.keystore.password` and `https` protocol is
recommended

*MQTT broker configuration*
----
mcc.mqtt.broker.enable=true # <1>
mcc.mqtt.broker.bind.address=0.0.0.0 # <2>
mcc.mqtt.broker.port=1883 # <3>
mcc.mqtt.broker.websocket.port=7080 # <4>
mcc.mqtt.broker.persistent.store=../conf/moquette/moquette_store.mapdb # <5>
----

<1> Enable/disable builtin MQTT broker. By default it is enabled. `true`- enabled, `false` - disabled
<2> Bind interface address for the MQTT broker. By default it will bind to all available interfaces.
<3> MQTT broker port

<5> Internal use. no need to touch this one.


*Logger configuration*

Configuration File Name: `logback.xml`

Default log file location: `logs/mycontroller.log`

====== Start/Stop Server
Executable scripts are located in `mycontroller/bin/`
