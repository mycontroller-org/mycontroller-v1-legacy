== About

*MyController.org* is automation controller for home, office or any place.
Primarly this project started to support http://www.mysensors.org/[MySensors]. But later it expands support to other network also. Considered system resources in mind on development, as a outcome even we can run it on Raspberry PI (256 MB) very first model.

== Localization
MyController.org supports multiple languages. If you have interest to add/translate your native language for MyController.org send a request on https://www.transifex.com/mycontrollerorg/multi-locale/[Transifex MyController.org locale project]

== System Requirement

MyController.org is a very lightweight server, It required very less resource, believe me ;)

  * Disk        : ~30 MB (may require more space, when we store metrics data for long time)
  * Memory(RAM) : 40 MB
  * Java        : 1.8 or later

  NOTE: Test done up to 5 nodes and 30 sensors with the above configuration.

===== Supported Platforms (tested)
MyController.org is java based application server. We can run it in any platform where Java support is available.

- Linux
- Windows
- Raspberry PI (Oracle Java recommend)

File: `mycontroller.properties`

*Temporary file*
----
mcc.tmp.location=tmp/ # <1>
----
<1> You can change default location and file name. This file used as server temporery location. Used for the operation such as backup, restore, etc.,

*Database Configuration*
----

----

<1> bind interface address. by default it will bind with all the available interface.
<2> Enable/disable https. Only one protocol supported at a time. true - `https`, false - `http`.
<3> Port number of `http/https` to access MyController.org server.
<4> web files location, no need to touch this one.
<5> If `https` is enabled these fields are mandatory.

Default URL: `https://<ip>:8443` (ex: `https://localhost:8443`)

NOTE: Default username/password: `admin/admin`

*Important*: Change default `mcc.web.ssl.keystore.file` and `mcc.web.ssl.keystore.password` and `https` protocol is
recommended
