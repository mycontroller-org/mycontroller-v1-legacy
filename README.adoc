== About

*MyController.org* is a controller for the http://www.mysensors.org/[MySensors] project. Considered system resources in mind. Even we can run it on Raspberry PI (256 MB) very first model.

== System Requirement

MyController.org server is very lightweight, It required very less resource, believe me ;)

  * Disk        : ~30 MB
  * Memory(RAM) : 40 MB
  * Java        : 1.8 or later

  NOTE: Test done up to 5 nodes and 30 sensors with the above configuration.

===== Supported Platforms (tested)
MyController.org is java based application server. We can run it in any platform which supports Java.

- Linux
- Windows
- Raspberry PI (Oracle Java recommend)

== Available Features

Features available in https://github.com/mycontroller-org/mycontroller/releases/tag/0.0.2-alpha5[0.0.2-alpha5] version,

== Installation

====== Download(executable bundle),

* https://github.com/mycontroller-org/mycontroller/releases/download/0.0.2-alpha5/mycontroller-standalone-0.0.2-alpha5-bundle.zip[mycontroller-standalone-0.0.2-alpha5-bundle.zip]
* https://github.com/mycontroller-org/mycontroller/releases/download/0.0.2-alpha5/mycontroller-standalone-0.0.2-alpha5-bundle.tar.gz[mycontroller-standalone-0.0.2-alpha5-bundle.tar.gz]

====== Configuration

Extract downloaded bundle where exactly do you want to run. Configuration files located in `mycontroller/conf`

File: `mycontroller.properties`

*Select your gateway*
```
mcc.ethernet.gateway.type=ethernet
```
- `mcc.ethernet.gateway.type`: Available gateway types: serial, ethernet, mqtt

*Serial Port Gateway Configuration*
```
mcc.serialport.driver.type=auto
mcc.serialport.name=/dev/ttyUSB0
mcc.serialport.baud.rate=115200
```
- `mcc.serialport.driver.type`: Available driver types: `pi4j, jssc, jserialcomm, auto`. It is recommended to keep in `auto`. *For now `jssc` driver is not stable with MyController.org*
- `mcc.serialport.name` : will vary based on platform and number of ports. Find it on your computer and update
- `mcc.serialport.baud.rate` : by default http://www.mysensors.org/build/serial_gateway[Serial Gateway] uses `115200`. If you changed on your setup you have to update your custom value here.

*Ethernet Gateway Configuration*
```
mcc.ethernet.gateway.host=192.168.178.6
mcc.ethernet.gateway.port=5003
mcc.ethernet.gateway.keep.alive.frequency=60
```
- `mcc.ethernet.gateway.host`: Host name/ip of your Ethernet Gateway
- `mcc.ethernet.gateway.port`: Ethernet Gateway port
- `mcc.ethernet.gateway.keep.alive.frequency`: This field is used to monitor Ethernet Gateway. If Connection goes try to reconnect automatically. Value in seconds.

*MQTT Gateway*
```
mcc.mqtt.gateway.broker.host=192.168.178.6
mcc.mqtt.gateway.broker.port=1883
mcc.mqtt.gateway.broker.root.topic=MyMQTT
```
- `mcc.mqtt.gateway.broker.host`: MQTT Gateway Hostname/IP
- `mcc.mqtt.gateway.broker.port`: MQTT Gateway port
- `mcc.mqtt.gateway.broker.root.topic`: Topic name, Should be same name that we used in MQTT Gateway(MQTT_BROKER_PREFIX)

*Database Configuration*
```
mcc.h2db.location=../conf/mycontroller
```
You can change default location and file name. File will be stored with the file extension `.h2.db`. Do not add file extenstion.

*Web server configuration*
```
enable.https=true
http.port=8443
ssl.keystore.file=../conf/keystore.jks
ssl.keystore.password=password
ssl.keystore.type=JKS
```
- `enable.https` : Enable/disable https. Only one protocol supported at a time.
- `http.port` : Port number you want to access MyController.org server
- `ssl.keystore.file, ssl.keystore.password, ssl.keystore.type` : If https is enabled these fields are mandatory.

Default URL: `https://<ip>:8443` (ex: `https://localhost:8443`)

Default username/password: `admin/admin`

IMPORTANT: Change default `ssl.keystore.file` and `ssl.keystore.password` and https protocol is recommended

*Logger configuration*

Configuration File Name: `logback.xml`

Default log file location: `logs/mycontroller.log`

====== Start/Stop Server
Executable scripts are located in `mycontroller/bin/`

* Linux
    - Start : `./start.sh`
    - Stop  : `./stop.sh`

* Windows
    - Start : Double click on `start.bat`
    - Stop  : `Ctrl+C`

* Other Platforms
    
```
java -Xms8m -Xmx40m -Dlogback.configurationFile=../conf/logback.xml -Dmc.conf.file=../conf/mycontroller.properties -jar ../lib/mycontroller-standalone-0.0.1-single.jar
```
